      <h2> What Is Crypto?<h2>
        <p>
          Cryptocurrency is a digital/virtual currency that is secured by cryptography which makes it nearly
          impossible to counterfeit. Most cryptocurrency are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology.
          Blockchains maintain a secure record of transactions; it collects information together in groups known as
          “blocks.” Blocks have certain storage capacities, are closed when filled and linked to the previously filled
          block forming a chain of data known as the “blockchain.” Cryptocurrency is not issued by any central
          authority, rendering them immune to government interference or manipulation. In short, cryptocurrency is a
          free market, anyone has the ability to buy, sell or make cryptocurrency. Some of the most prominent
          cryptocurrency is, Bitcoin, Shiba, Etheruem, and Solana. </p>

      <h2>What are NFTS?<h2>
        <p>
          NFTS also known as non-fungible tokens are digital artworks put up for bidding on the ethereum block chain. NFTS are unique and irreplaceable, each NFT is completely different then any other. NFTS are non-fungible which means they can not be traded for the same thing. You can trade a bitcoin for another bitcoin, but you can not trade an NFT for an identical NFT. If you start with an NFT and trade it you'll have a completely different work of art. NFTs are designed to give you something that can’t be copied: ownership of the work. You can download a copy as much as you want, same as buying a copy of the Mona Lisa. But only one person will ever own the original. The introduction of NFTS gave artists a new way to accumulate income and a new platform to show off their artwork. Anyone is able to create an NFT, as well as sell and profit from them.

      <h2> The History of NFTs & Crypto <h2>
        <p>
          The idea of cryptocurrency was first theorized among scholars and programmers in the 1980s due to the general annoyance with centralized finance. In 1995, David Chaum created the first iteration of crypto with Digicash. While innovative, it failed to gain a large user base. In 1998, Nick Szabo developed Bit Gold which most people consider to be the precursor to bitcoin. It was based on users using their computer power to solve cryptographic puzzles, and receiving a reward; similar to mining bitcoin. In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published a paper called “Bitcoin – A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System”. This was the first idea of a blockchain technology, using proof of work (PoW) verification to secure transactions. He mined the very first block of bitcoin on January 3rd, 2009 with the value being a fraction of a cent. Bitcoin hit $1 in 2011, $1000 in 2013, $19,000 in 2017 and $75,000 today. The second largest cryptocurrency is ethereum, created in 2015 by Vitalik Buterin. It hit $1 within the first year, steadily rising until present day; valued at over $4000.

      <h2>What is DeFi?<h2>
        <p>
          Decentralized finance (DeFi) is the general idea of financial transactions managed through a number of entities rather than one central bank. Traditionally, when you make a purchase, your money goes through the bank which can stop, pause or record it into its private ledger. This worry is completely removed with DeFi, because you can directly pay for items without going through a central bank. Several entities hold transaction records increasing security and efficiency. Currencies such as bitcoin and ethereum are built on this technology using 2 main protocols known as “Proof of Work” (PoW) and “Proof of Stake”(PoS). Proof of work essentially allows users to use their computers computation power to help manage financial transactions, this is also known as “mining”. The problem is mining uses insane amounts of energy reading to environmental concerns. Proof of Stake (PoS) gives mining power based on the percentage of coins held by a miner. This results in significantly lower energy consumption but not every crypto currency can use it.

      <h2>The Benefits of Crypto & NFTs<h2>
          <p>
            Cryptocurrency/DeFi has many benefits opposed to traditional finance. With crypto, there's little to no transaction fees, no limit on purchases/withdrawals, no paperwork/documentation required to use it and much faster international transfers. NFTs have many other benefits on top of cryptos. NFTs offer people the ability to sell art, collectables, luxury goods, games among other things online without the risk of plagiarism. NFTs are non fungible, only one person can buy it, and they cannot be replicated or divided in any way. Prior to NFTs, there weren't many ways to ensure ownership of digital goods. Now, NFTs have created thousands of jobs contributing to an industry worth over $1.2 trillion.

      <h2>The Issues of Crypto & NFTs<h2>
          <p>
            While cryptocurrency has many benefits, it is debated whether or not the pros outweigh the cons. The main issue regarding crypto is the environmental impact due to its immense energy use. It’s estimated that bitcoin transactions use more than 100,000x the energy of credit cards and ethereum transactions use more than 5000x the energy of credit cards. The same logic applies to NFTs, it’s estimated that minting an NFT is equivalent to driving a car for 1000 km and a single NFT transaction is equivalent to the  daily energy use of a modern household. This energy use quickly depletes computer hardware, creates hardware shortages, raises energy prices, and contributes to the ongoing climate crisis. While there's been effort to reduce energy use with the creation of the more efficient “Proof of Stake” transactions, it’s yet to catch on and make a difference. This is due to not all crypto currencies being able to use PoS, specifically bitcoin, which is responsible for a majority of the environmental concerns.
